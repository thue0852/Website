					<h2>Work Experience</h2>
					<p>A Data Scientist proficient in SAS, SQL and VBA. I can communicate results to people of varying technical ability and enjoy presenting results in a way that is easy to interpret. I have worked at all stages of a data analytics framework from data cleaning and sourcing to MI reporting.</p>
					<p>HSBC Global FX – Technical Business Analyst, London | Jan 2017 – Present
					Working in Global FX, my role requires technical ability as well as project and stakeholder management to build out the client optimisation analysis.
					My focus has been creating a dashboard which shows operational metrics at a client level, which will be used to shape discussions with the client with the Front Office. This involves SQL and VBA to create an excel based dashboard that updates monthly.
					</p>
					<p>CMC Markets – Data Scientist, London | Jan 2016 – Jan 2017
					•	I was part of the Business Intelligence team, I investigated how volatility in financial markets effects trading behaviour. I found variables that are highly correlated with volatility, defined high volatility, and analysed differences between periods of high volatility and low volatility. This project is a lucrative area for CMC Markets, as volatility increases market participation which impacts CMC’s revenues in a very direct way.
					•	Improved global targets for all key metrics (number of applications, live accounts, traded accounts) by incorporating the volatility impact as well as taking a more sophisticated approach to forecasting. This reduced the variance in the target vs actual from 27% to 2%. I used VBA to automate the variance analysis to continually adjust forecasts based on the variability of the model.
					</p>
					<p>KPMG - Data Analytics Consultant, London | Jan 2014 - Jan 2016
					•	I completed data quality testing and data traceability for the standard formula calculation of a global insurance firm. This enabled them to become regulatory compliant, and can report their solvency capital requirement on request, automated and fully auditable.
					•	I worked on an investigation into LIBOR manipulation by an international bank.
						used SAS to produce essential insight from a single repository that consisted of unstructured (Email, Audio, IM) and structured (Trade and Market) data. 
						Completed statistical analysis to place weights on certain market factors that can influence LIBOR and analysed the covariance of LIBOR submissions between days and between the 16 submitting banks for each tenor.
						Created a slide deck and communicating the team’s analysis to senior stakeholders. This was used to present key findings and evidence in court.
					•	Defined the early stages of a remediation project at a large UK/Spanish bank.
						Reviewed SAS code which defined the total population of customers who were eligible to be a part of the remediation activity. I created and implemented tests to ensure the population identified was robust and explained complicated SAS logic to non-technical senior clients.
					•	Completed customer screening analytics for a large Australian bank to identify potentially high risk clients.
						Matching terms with the World Watch List and other Sanctions or politically exposed person’s checklists to report back to the client using QlikView. This resulted in a reduction of manual investigative work by over 50%.
					•	I worked on an Interest Rate Derivative review for a large UK based commercial bank.
						I worked across data governance, redress delivery and MI reporting where my role included large scale data mining between different archived systems using SQL and providing the project with explanations of the data. I also created and owned an access database that tracked cases through the redress process. In the MI reporting team, I provided reports to the programme Director, the Operational Director and the Steering Committee.
					</p>
					<p>Nationwide Building Society - Marketing Effectiveness Analyst, Swindon | Sept 2013 – Jan 2014
					•	I analysed the effectiveness of different marketing campaigns using SAS, and proposed ways to maximise the rate of return by segmenting data into types of consumers that respond particularly well to certain campaigns. This increased the effectiveness of letters which increased retention rates by 5%.
